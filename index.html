            <p>Running. Why the hell do we do it? For some, it's a way to relieve stress. For some it may be an excuse to have a drink. And others love to push themselves and see what the human body is capable of doing. Some runners do it to meet people while others toe the line every weekend and are ready to put it all out there. Some might run in the morning to catch the purple and orange sunrise and others run in the evening to catch the red sunset. No matter why you run or when you run, you seem to love it and you also deserve the best apparel.</p>
